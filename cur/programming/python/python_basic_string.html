        <p>
            In this section we will discuss the basic ways that strings (i.e. words and sentences) can be manipulated in python. To get started, open up the python interpreter like we did earlier on in the lab (if you forgot, simply enter <code>python3</code> into the shell).  To create a string, set a variable to text enclosed in quotes as shown below (notice that assigning a variable does not return it's value, we must do that seperately):
        </p>
        <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
              <tr>
                  <td>
                      <p><pre><code>
>>> name = "Alonzo"
                    </code></pre></p>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/set_name_to_alonzo.png"/>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>
                      <p><pre><code>
>>> name
"Alonzo"
                    </code></pre></p>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/name.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
              Next, set a variable called name to your name (or the name of someone else).  We can then use the len() function to get the length of the variable:
          </p>
          <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
              <tr>
                  <td>
                      <p><pre><code>
>>> name = "Alonzo"
>>> len(name)
6
                    </code></pre></p>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/lengthofname.png"/>
                </td>
              </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
              To access certain letters of a string we can do the following:
          </p>
          <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
              <tr>
                  <td>
                      <p><pre><code>
>>> name[0]
'A'
                    </code></pre></p>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/letter1_of_name.png"/>
                </td>
              </tr>
          </table>
          <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
            <b>Why is the first letter at position 0?</b>
            <br>
              Notice that the output letter is actually surrounded in single quotes (<code>'A'</code>). We can also make strings using single quotes.  The most important thing to notice is that the first letter is located at the "0th" position.  Unlike in Snap<em>!</em> where the first letter was simply letter 1 of word, in python the first letter is at position 0.  Having the first element at the 0th position is called <b>"0 indexing"</b> and is standard in most programming languages.
          </p>
          <p>
              To get the <b>last letter</b> of a string we can do one of the following in python:
          </p>
          <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
              <tr>
                  <td>
                      <p><pre><code>
>>> name[len(name) - 1]
'o'
>>> name[-1]
'o'
                    </code></pre></p>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/letterLengthOf_name.png"/>
                </td>
              </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
              To join strings together (aka <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.merriam-webster.com%2Fdictionary%2Fconcatenate&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH2OV_JvGvcrrzfvj45Wf--C6vmhQ" target="_blank">concatenate</a> them) in python we can do the following:
          </p>
          <table style="width:auto; table-height:200px">
              <tr>
                  <td>
                      <p><pre><code>
>>> name + " says hello"
'Alonzo says hello'
                    </code></pre></p>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/join_name_alonzo.png"/>
                </td>
              </tr>
          </table>
          <p class="alert alert-danger quoteRed">
            Note that using the <code>+</code> operator to join strings creates a new string and does not modify the old string. This means that joining two strings as shown above does not change the value of the variable <code>name</code>! You'll need to use the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) to actually change the value of a variable.
          </p>
          <h3>Substrings</h3>
          <p>
              In Python we can also easily create substrings of a string by using some special Python syntax as shown below (note that Snap<em>!</em> does not have a default function to do this):
          </p>
          <p><pre><code>
>>> name[1:5]
'lonz'
>>> name[:3]
'Alo'
>>> name[3:]
'nzo'
>>> name[:3] + name[3:]
'Alonzo'
        </code></pre></p>
        <p class="alert alert-warning quoteOrange">
             Substring <code>[start:end]</code> returns the letters in the word from <code>start</code> to <code>end-1</code> (notice this is exactly how <code>range(x, y)</code> worked.  The upper index value is not included), so always be careful with your indexing when using the substring and range functions.
        </p>
        <h3>Exercise 3:</h3>
        <p class="alert alert-success quoteGreen">
            Write the function <code>reverse_string(string)</code> that takes in a string and puts it in the reverse order as shown below:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> reverse_string("Alonzo")
'oznolA'

        </code></pre></p>
        <p> For this problem, instead of dragging and dropping code in the browser, you will write code free form using a text editor. To do so, open up your <code>lab1.py</code> file that you created, and define a new function. If you need help, refer to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/python/run_a_python_script.html">this page</a> or ask a staff member for help!</p>

        <p class="alert alert-info quoteBlue">
            You'll want to use some sort of loop, along with some of the things that you've learned about strings in this section.  When you think your function works, you can run the tests we've provided in our autograder. To run the autograder, first download <a href="/bjc/prog/python/autograder.py">this file</a> <i>and place it into the same directory (folder) as <code>lab1.py</code>. Then, in your Terminal window, you can run the following command to check for correctness:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code class="lang-bash">
python3 autograder.py lab1.py
        </code></pre></p>
